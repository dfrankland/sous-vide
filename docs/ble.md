# Anova Bluetooth API

These commands and notes have been extracted from the Anova Culinary app v2.1.0
APK. Anova devices use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and can only work with other
devices that have this capability.

## How to Connect and Communicate

1.  Use the local name to recognize an Anova device.

2.  Use the device discovered and find the service on it that matches the listed
    service UUID.

3.  Use the service discovered and find the characteristics on it that matches
    the listed characteristic UUID.

4.  Use the characteristic discovered and listen for data, subscribe, and then
    write commands to it.

## How to Send Commands

*   Commands should be executed in a queue.

*   The queue should have an allotted timeout for each command.

*   Each command should be delimited by an "empty" command.

*   Each command must be written in sets of max 20 bytes with `\r` signaling the
    end of a single command.

## How to Receive Data

As data is received from the discovered characteristic, it must be concatenated
into a string until `\r` is received signaling the end.

## Bluetooth Constants

*   Local name: `Anova`

*   Device service UUID: `ffe0`

*   Device characteristic UUID: `ffe1`
